				let Your enormous Library be justified. <br> <br>

				<sup id=shelf4>3</sup>The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the 
				reasonable (and even humble and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. <br> <br>

				<sup id=shelf4>4</sup>They speak (I know) of the "feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in danger 
				of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity." <br> <br>

				<sup id=shelf4>5</sup>These words, which not only denounce the disorder but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove 
				their authors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance.
