		<p> Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, <br>
			perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am <br>
			preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there <br>
			will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; <br>
			my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite. <br>
			I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form <br>
			of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal <br>
			room is inconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing <br>
			a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; <br>
			but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for <br>
			me to repeat the classic dictum: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and <br>
			whose circumference is inaccessible.  </p>
