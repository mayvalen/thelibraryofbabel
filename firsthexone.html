			The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV <br><br>

			The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite 
			number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. 
			From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors. <br> <br>

			The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides 
			except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of 
			a normal bookcase. <br> <br>
			
			One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, 
			identical to the first and to all the rest. <br> <br>

			To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep 
			standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities.
