		<p> First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate corollary is the 
			future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. <br> <br>

			Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi; 
			the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of 
			inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can 
			only be the work of a god.<br> <br>
			
			To perceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these 
			crude wavering symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic 
			letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical. <br> <br>

			Second: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number. <br> <br>
			
			This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library 
			and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic 
			nature of almost all the books.
