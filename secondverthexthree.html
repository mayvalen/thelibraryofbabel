		<p> One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV, 
		    perversely repeated from the first line to the last. <br><br>
				
			Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page
			says Oh time thy pyramids. <br> <br>

			This much is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues 
			of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose 
			librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate 
			it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm... <br> <br>

			They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain 
			that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, 
			we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.) <br> <br>
			
			For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded 
			to past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different 
			from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical 
			and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible.
