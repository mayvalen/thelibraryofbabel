		<p> Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars 
			upwards to remote distances. <br> <br>
			
			In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror 
			that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished 
			surfaces represent and promise the infinite... <br> <br>
			
			Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. <br> <br>
			
			There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is 
			insufficient, incessant. <br> <br>
			
			Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book,
			perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing 
			to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born.
