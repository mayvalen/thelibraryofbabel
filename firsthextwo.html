		<p> There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books <br>
			 of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, <br>
			 each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the spine <br>
			 of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that <br>
			 this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, <br>
			 in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall <br>
