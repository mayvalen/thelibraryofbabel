		<p> The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated with examples 
			of variations with unlimited repetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius 
			to discover the fundamental law of the Library.<br> <br>

			This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the 
			same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. <br> <br>
			
			He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two 
			identical books.<br> <br>

			From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves 
			register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, 
			though extremely vast, is not infinite):<br> <br>

			Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful 
			catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy 
			of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, 
			the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, 
			the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.
