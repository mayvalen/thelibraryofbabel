			<p> I believe I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years. <br> <br>
                
                Perhaps my old age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the 
                human species - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, <br><br>
                
                but the Library will endure: <br> <br>
                
                illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, 
                equipped with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret. <br> <br>

                I have just written the word "infinite". <br> <br>
