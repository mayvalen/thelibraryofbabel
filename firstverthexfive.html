			<p> which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues 
				do not contain a terrible meaning. <br> <br>

				No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, 
				which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a god. <br> <br>
				
				To speak is 
				to fall into tautology. <br> <br>

				This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the 
				five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as well. <br> <br>

				(An n number of possible languages use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the 
				symbol library allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of 
				hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven 
				words which define it have another value. <br> <br>
