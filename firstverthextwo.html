			<p> How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him? <br> <br>

				Someone proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, consult first book 
				B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, 
				and so on to infinity... <br> <br>

				In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. <br> <br>

				It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf 
				of the universe 3; I pray to the unknown gods that a man—just one, even 
				though it were thousands of years ago!—may have examined and read it. <br> <br>

				If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others.
