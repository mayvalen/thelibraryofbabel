				leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves: <br> <br>
				
				their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books. <br> <br>

				this frenzy neglect two notable facts. <br> <br>

				One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal. <br> <br>

				The other: every copy is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there 
				are always several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a 
				letter or a comma.
