			<p> In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted 
				by the twenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. <br> <br>

				It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration 
				is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. <br> <br>

				These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or 
				allegorical manner; <br> <br>

				some characters <br> <br>
