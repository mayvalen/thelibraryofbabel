		<p> There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five 
			books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty 
			lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. <br> <br>
			
			There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or 
			prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed 
			mysterious. <br> <br>
			
			Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic 
			projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms. <br> <br>

			First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate corollary is the 
			future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. <br> <br>

			Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi; 
			the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of 
			inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can 
			only be the work of a god.<br> <br>
