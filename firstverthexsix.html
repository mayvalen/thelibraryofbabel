			<p> <sup id=shelf5>1</sup>You who read me, are You sure of understanding my language?) <br> <br>
				
				<sup id=shelf5>2</sup>The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men. <br> <br>

				<sup id=shelf5>3</sup>The certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. <br> <br>

				<sup id=shelf5>4</sup>I know of districts in which the young men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages 
				in a barbarous manner, but they do not know how to decipher a single letter. <br> <br>
