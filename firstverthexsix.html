				The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men. <br> <br>

				The certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. <br> <br>

				I know of districts in which the young men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages 
				in a barbarous manner, but they do not know how to decipher a single letter. <br> <br>

				Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry, 
				have decimated the population. <br> <br>
