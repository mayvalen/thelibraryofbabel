            <sup id=shelf7>2</sup>Before, there was a man for every three hexagons. Suicide and pulmonary diseases have 
            destroyed that proportion. <br><br>
            
            <sup id=shelf7>3</sup>A memory of unspeakable melancholy: at times I have traveled 
            for many nights through corridors and along polished stairways without finding a single librarian. <br><br>
            
            <sup id=shelf7>4</sup>3 <br> <br>
            
            <sup id=shelf7>5</sup>I repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is excluded. 
            For example: no book can be a ladder, although no doubt there are books which discuss and negate 
            and demonstrate this possibility and others whose structure corresponds to that of a ladder. <br> <br>
