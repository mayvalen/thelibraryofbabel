		<p> Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the 
			fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, 
			which is infinite. <br> <br>
			
			I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of 
			absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. <br> <br>
			
			They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable. <br> <br>
			
			(The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, 
			whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; 
			their words, obscure. <br> <br>

			This cyclical book is God.)
