			<p> <sup id=shelf6>1</sup>I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: <br> <br>

                <sup id=shelf6>2</sup>The Library is unlimited and cyclical. <br> <br>

                <sup id=shelf6>3</sup>If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that 
                the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder <br> <br>
                
				<sup id=shelf6>4</sup>(which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). <br> <br>

                <sup id=shelf6>5</sup>My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope 4.
