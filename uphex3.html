			<p> I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: <br> <br>

                The Library is unlimited and cyclical. <br> <br>

                If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that 
                the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder <br> <br>
                
                (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). <br> <br>

                My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope 4.
