			<sup id=shelf>1</sup>The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons 
			who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a 
			man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be computed as zero. <br> <br>

			- the origin of the Library and of time - might be found. <br> <br>
			
			<sup id=shelf>3</sup>It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could be explained in words: if the language of philosophers 
			is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have produced the unprecedented language 
			required, with its vocabularies and grammars.<br> <br>

			inquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: <br> <br>

			them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the 
			nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words.<br> <br>
