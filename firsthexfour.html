		<p> For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote <br>
			languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite <br>
			different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is <br>
			dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, <br>
			is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, <br>
			no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could <br>
			influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 71 was not the <br>
			one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not <br>
			prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though <br>
			not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators  </p>
