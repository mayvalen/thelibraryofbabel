		<p> All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MCV's 
			cannot correspond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be.<br> <br>

			Some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value 
			of MCV in the third line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another
			position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail.<br> <br>

			Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though 
			not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators.<br> <br>

			Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a book as confusing 
			as the others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines. <br> <br>
			
			He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; 
			others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian 
			dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections.
