		<p> Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a book as confusing as the <br>
			others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines. He showed his find to a wandering <br>
			decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. <br>
			Within a century, the language was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, <br>
			with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative <br>
			analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition.  </p>
