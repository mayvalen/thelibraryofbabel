		<p> Obviously, no one expects to discover anything.<br> <br>

			As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive depression. The certitude 
			that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books and that these precious books were 
			inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable.<br> <br>

			A blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle 
			letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books.
			The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders. <br> <br>
			
			The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, would 
			hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly 
			mimic the divine disorder.<br> <br>

			Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works.
