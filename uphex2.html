			<p> I have not interpolated this adjective out 
                of rhetorical habit; <br> <br>
                
                I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite. <br> <br>

                Those who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairways 
                and hexagons can conceivably come to an end <br> <br>

                which is absurd <br> <br>

                Those who imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books does have such a limit. <br> <br>
