            <sup id=shelf7>2</sup>Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: <br> <br>
            
            <sup id=shelf7>3</sup>rigorously speaking, a single volume would be sufficient, a volume of ordinary format, printed 
            in nine or ten point type, containing an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves. <br> <br>
            
            <sup id=shelf7>4</sup>(In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies are the superimposition of 
            an infinite number of planes.) <br> <br>
            
            <sup id=shelf7>5</sup>The handling of this silky vade mecum would not be convenient: each apparent page would unfold 
            into other analogous ones; the inconceivable middle page would have no reverse.<br> <br>
