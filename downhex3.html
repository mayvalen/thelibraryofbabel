            Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: <br> <br>
            
            rigorously speaking, a single volume would be sufficient, a volume of ordinary format, printed 
            in nine or ten point type, containing an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves. <br> <br>
            
            (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies are the superimposition of 
            an infinite number of planes.) <br> <br>
            
            The handling of this silky vade mecum would not be convenient: each apparent page would unfold 
            into other analogous ones; the inconceivable middle page would have no reverse.<br> <br>
