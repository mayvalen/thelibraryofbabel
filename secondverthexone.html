		<p> <sup id=shelf2>1</sup>Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum: The Library is a sphere whose 
			exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible. <br> <br>

			<sup id=shelf2>2</sup>There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five 
			books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty 
			lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. <br> <br>
			
			<sup id=shelf2>3</sup>There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or 
			prefigure what the pages will say. <br> <br>
			
			<sup id=shelf2>4</sup>I know that this incoherence at one time seemed 
			mysterious. <br> <br>
			
			<sup id=shelf2>5</sup>Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic 
			projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.
