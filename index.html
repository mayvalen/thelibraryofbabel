		<p> The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite <br>
		number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. <br>
		From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution <br>
		of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides <br>
		except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of <br>
		a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, <br>
		identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very <br>
		small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. <br>
		Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. <br>
		In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from <br>
		this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer <br>
		to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... Light is provided by some <br>
		spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. <br>
		The light they emit is insufficient, incessant. </p>
